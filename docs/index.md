## Features
- Lightweight and fast container runtime.
- Written in Rust for memory safety and performance.
- Supports basic container isolation using Linux namespaces.

## Motivation
Qube aims to provide a lightweight, secure, and efficient container runtime. Rust's memory safety and performance make it an ideal choice for implementing container runtimes. Qube is designed to be simple yet powerful, with a focus on extensibility and security.
